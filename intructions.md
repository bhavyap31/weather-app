I would like to have you work on a simple case study so that we can see how you write, style, and structure your code. 

If you could have it finished before Wednesday that would be ideal. However, if you're not available or you think you'd need more time, please let me know.

Simple weather app case study

• Create a simple weather application using React & Hooks. You may use any other deps that you would like.

• The application should display the current City, State, day of the week, time of day, temp, description of the weather, and an icon representing the weather (sunny should be a sun, cloudy a cloud, etc...) Feel free to make your own icons or use some that someone else has built.

• Structure your project in such a way that the main app loads a wrapper component, using some sort of online react environment
  example: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-playground-forked-cyf8z?file=/components/Test.jsx

• Logically structure your application for maximum clarity and reusability.

• Pull in data from an opensource weather api, via an ajax call (axios or another library would be fine)
  example: https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{long}

• Save the data to state, using Hooks, and render it to the view

• The view should include all the info in step one, visually laid out in any way you would like it. It does not have to be super complex, but bonus points for style.
  example: https://dribbble.com/shots/11474539-Weather-App

• Bonus: use the current users geolocation coordinates to populate the lat/long instead of hardcoding the values to the api.

• Any neat functionality you'd like to add on top to make it stand out.

Thank you, we look forward to seeing what you come up with.

Thanks again.
